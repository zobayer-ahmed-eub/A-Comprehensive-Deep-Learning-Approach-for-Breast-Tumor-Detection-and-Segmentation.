## 📌 Project Overview

This repository houses the code for an **end-to-end automated system** designed to detect, classify, and segment breast lesions in ultrasound images. Developed as part of a Master's thesis, this system aims to assist radiologists by providing a "second opinion" using advanced Deep Learning techniques.

The framework performs two parallel tasks:

1.  **Classification:** Diagnoses lesions as **Normal, Benign, or Malignant**.
2.  **Segmentation:** Generates precise masks to delineate lesion boundaries.

## 📂 Data Availability

To ensure robust generalization across different ultrasound devices and patient demographics, this study utilizes a **combined dataset** merged from three open-source repositories.

The models were trained and evaluated on a unified compilation of the following sources:

1.  **BUSI (Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset)**

      * **Source:** Al-Dhabyani et al. (2020)
      * **Description:** Contains 780 images with ground truth maps, categorized into normal, benign, and malignant classes.
      * **Reference:** *Data in Brief, 28, 104863.*

2.  **BUS-UCLM (Breast Ultrasound Lesion Segmentation Dataset)**

      * **Source:** Vallez et al. (2024)
      * **Description:** Comprises 683 images from 38 patients, collected to improve segmentation accuracy in difficult clinical cases.
      * **Reference:** *Scientific Data (Nature), 12, 242.*

3.  **BrEaST-Lesions\_USG**

      * **Source:** Kasprzak et al. / Kaggle
      * **Folder Name:** `BrEaST-Lesions_USG-images_and_masks`
      * **Description:** A diverse collection of ultrasound images including patient-level annotations, used to further augment the training diversity.

> **⚠️ Data Access & Privacy:**
> Due to medical data licensing and GitHub file size limits, the raw image files are **not** included in this repository.
>
>   * **Instructions:** Download the datasets from their respective official sources (Kaggle/Mendeley Data), merge them into a single directory structure, and update the `DATA_DIR` path in the notebooks.

## 🚀 Key Features

  * **Hybrid Deep Learning:** Utilizes both **CNNs** (ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt) and **Transformers** for robust feature extraction.
  * **Advanced Techniques:**
      * **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Blocks:** To recalibrate channel-wise feature responses.
      * **Focal Loss:** To address class imbalance between normal, benign, and malignant samples.
      * **Ensemble Boosting:** Combines weak learners to improve classification accuracy.
